"""aHydro initial-condition analysis utilities (Version 2)

Author: Sabin Thapa <sthapa3@kent.edu>

This small package is meant to live inside a research repo (e.g. notebooks/src/)
and provide fast, reusable, reproducible utilities for:

- Optical Glauber geometry (AA, pA, dA)
- (Optional) MC Glauber event sampling + entropy-based centrality
- aHydro-style tilted initial energy-density profiles ε(x,y,ς)

All distances are in fm unless stated otherwise.
